# Context: iOS CI/CD for Diplicity React

I'm working on a full-stack Diplomacy board game app called **Diplicity React**. I want to set up CI/CD for the iOS app so that changes to `main` automatically produce a new iOS release, and I can also produce test builds. I'd like your help thinking through the approach.

## What the project is

A Diplomacy board game web + mobile app:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite web app at `/packages/web/`
- **Backend**: Django REST API at `/service/`
- **iOS**: Capacitor wraps the web app into a native iOS app
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose locally, Railway + Azure in production

The iOS app is essentially a native shell (Capacitor) around the web build. The web app is built with `npm run build` (produces `/packages/web/dist/`), then `npx cap sync ios` copies those web assets into the native iOS project. Then the Xcode project at `packages/web/ios/App/App.xcodeproj` is built and signed.

## Current iOS project details

**Bundle ID**: `com.diplicity.app`
**Team ID**: `G76UP8FNMS`
**Scheme**: `App`
**Xcode project path**: `packages/web/ios/App/App.xcodeproj` (no .xcworkspace)
**Swift Package Manager**: Dependencies managed via `packages/web/ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`
**Min iOS version**: 15
**Code signing**: Xcode automatic signing (`CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic`)
**Current version**: `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0`, `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1`

**Info.plist** uses build setting variables:
- `CFBundleShortVersionString` = `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` — the user-visible version (e.g., "1.2.0")
- `CFBundleVersion` = `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` — the build number (must be unique per upload)

**Dependencies** (Swift Package Manager via CapApp-SPM):
- `capacitor-swift-pm` (Capacitor 8.1.0)
- Currently no other native dependencies (PR #189 would add `@capgo/capacitor-social-login`)

**Gitignored iOS files**:
- `packages/web/ios/App/build/`
- `packages/web/ios/App/App/public/` (generated by cap sync)
- `*.mobileprovision`, `*.cer`
- `AuthKey*` (APNs keys)

## Current CI/CD (web + backend only, no iOS)

There is NO existing iOS CI/CD. Here's what exists today:

### GitHub Actions workflows:

**`build-and-deploy-service.yml`** (on push to main):
- Builds Django Docker image
- Deploys to Azure Container Registry + Web App
- Deploys to Railway via Railway CLI
- Waits for both to be healthy

**`build-and-deploy-web.yml`** (on push to main):
- Builds web frontend (`npm run build`)
- Deploys to Azure Static Web Apps

**`test-service.yml`** (on PRs): Runs Django tests
**`test-e2e.yml`** (on PRs): Runs Playwright E2E tests

### Build commands for iOS (currently manual):
```bash
cd packages/web
npm run build                    # Build web assets
npx cap sync ios                 # Copy web assets to iOS project
xcodebuild -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj -scheme App \
  -destination 'id=<DEVICE_UDID>' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=G76UP8FNMS CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic \
  build
```

## Apple credentials and signing

- **Apple Development cert**: `Apple Development: John McDowell (P96LAJ7FF8)` — for device builds
- **Apple Distribution cert**: `Apple Distribution: John McDowell (G76UP8FNMS)` — for App Store (created Feb 2026, expires Feb 2027)
- **Xcode automatic signing** is used — Xcode manages provisioning profiles
- **APNs auth key**: `AuthKey_C6JM6K4J2X.p8` (Key ID: `C6JM6K4J2X`) — for push notifications, independent of distribution certs
- **No Fastlane** or Match currently set up
- **No App Store Connect API key** currently set up

## Environment variables needed for builds

```
# Google OAuth (needed for web build)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
VITE_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID="..."  (from PR #189)

# API URL
VITE_DIPLICITY_API_BASE_URL="https://diplicity-react-production.up.railway.app"

# Firebase (for push notifications)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="..."
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="..."
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="..."
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="..."
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="..."

# Sentry/Honeycomb (optional for builds)
VITE_SENTRY_DSN="..."
VITE_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="..."
```

## What I want to achieve

1. **Automatic App Store release**: When code is merged to `main`, automatically build the iOS app, increment the version/build number, and submit to App Store Connect (either for review or as a build that can be manually released).

2. **Test builds**: Be able to create test builds (TestFlight or ad-hoc) for QA testing before merging to main, or from specific branches.

## Questions I'm thinking about

- Should I use Fastlane or just raw xcodebuild + altool/xcrun commands?
- How should I handle code signing in CI? (Match? Manual cert management? App Store Connect API key?)
- How should versioning work? (Semantic versioning? Auto-increment build numbers?)
- Should I use GitHub Actions with macOS runners, or a service like Codemagic/Bitrise?
- How do I handle the Apple certificates and provisioning profiles securely in CI?
- What's the best TestFlight workflow for test builds?
- How does this interact with the Capacitor build process?
- Is there anything Capacitor-specific I need to worry about for CI?

## Constraints

- The app is not yet on the App Store (this would be the first submission)
- I'm an individual developer (not an organization), using personal Apple Developer account
- The repo is on GitHub (github.com/johnpooch/diplicity-react)
- Budget-conscious — prefer free/cheap solutions where possible
- I use Xcode automatic signing locally and would like the CI approach to be as simple as possible

Please help me think through the best approach for setting up iOS CI/CD for this project. I'm open to discussing trade-offs between different tools and approaches.
