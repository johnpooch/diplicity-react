# Diplicity React - Release Notes

## Sandbox Games and other requested features (October 18, 2025)

**Release Date:** October 18, 2025  

### 🎯 Feature: Sandbox Games

Diplicity now supports **Sandbox Games** - this allows players to create and manage single-player Diplomacy games for learning, testing strategies, and exploring different scenarios without time constraints.

#### What are Sandbox Games?

Sandbox Games are special single-player games where:
- **No time limits**: Phases don't automatically resolve - you control when to advance
- **Full control**: You play all 7 nations yourself
- **Private by default**: These games are not visible to other players
- **No diplomacy**: No channels or messaging (focus on pure strategy)
- **Immediate start**: Games begin right away without waiting for other players

#### 🎮 How to Use Sandbox Games

### Creating a Sandbox Game
1. Navigate to the main menu
2. Click "Create Game" 
3. Select "Sandbox Game" tab
4. Choose your preferred variant
5. Enter a game name
6. Click "Create Game" - your game will appear in the "Sandbox" tab on the home screen

### 🔧 Feature: Changes to how users' names are presented

Users' names are automatically set using their Google login. Some users want to be able to change their names. Users can now edit their display names directly from their profile. Their Google username is not exposed. The user's Google profile picture is still used. If there is the ask, we could allow users to replace their profile image, but that would require setting up image storage.

### ⚡ Improvement

Database queries for variant data have been optimized, reducing load times when browsing games and variants.
